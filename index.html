            Dear fellow poor people,
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Rich Asswater. I maed a fortune selling used tires in the 80s, but lost it all in a bitter divorce. You might remember me for my involvement in a 1992 sex scandal involving Henry Kissinger and Fred “Billy” Dingle. I lost my house and my livelihood, and I currently sleep in my 1984 Dodge Aries. Now I send this message to you from a public library imploring for help.
        </p>
        <p>
            I could write a book about the 1000s of old guys I know - I have friends, acquaintances, and enemies that I’ve met throughout the decades, and I even have some juicy political connections. My nephew, “Brad”, thinks I could make a lot of money cataloguing my vast social network, so he helped me set up a www on opensea.com to sell non-fungusible coins - “Brad” thinks I might have better luck making money here since my last book only sold 18 copies, half of which went to my 3rd ex-wife. 

        </p>
        <p>
            “Brad” helped me list a few of the old guys I know, but now I need to decide how much to charge for something like this. It’s important that I get moving on this soon - I owe Ricky Vikashenko an embarrassing amount of money. I may have to sell my Dodge Aries if this doesn’t pan out.
        </p>

            Would you add 1 ether to my coffers for:
            <ul>
                <li>an original Fred Armitage? This is the first old guy “Brad” helped me make - he’s a real whiz. When I was his age, I had already had 2 kids and needed to work as a lever puller  in the Mercury Auto plant in Philadelphia throughout the 60s. That’s where I met Fred. He used to take 5-hour lunch breaks to complain about his ex-wife.</li>
                <li>A Frank Rosenberg? I heard he needed lifetime therapy after his ear got caught in his own locker if you can believe that. </li>
                <li>George Vikashenko? This guy was my role model for how to run my used tire company - $20 Christmas bonuses, and was quick to cut out any unionization attempts before it could spread like cancer. He’d make Reagan proud.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Sincerely,<br/>
            Rich Asswater IV
